My little Incremental Game


Get as many coins as possible! WASD and Arrow-Keys to move!

More objects mean more coins, means more to collect!
min- and maxSpeed make Coins fall faster, speed will make you, the "player" faster.
Crit Chance will make coins worth more stuff, you gain "Crit-Damage * base value" per Crit hit.

Currently working on:
- Saving/Loading
- An upgrade which makes the player move by itself (currently just for testing purposes)
- Super Crits
- Prestige
